[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tristanwietsma/otp.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/tristanwietsma/otp) [![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/coveralls/tristanwietsma/otp.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/tristanwietsma/otp?branch=master) [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/tristanwietsma/otp?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/tristanwietsma/otp)

There are other Go implementations of OTP out there, but this one is mine.

## Status

- The math to calculate OTP codes is tested and in working order.
- Much more work to be done before this is a useful package for production use.
- Also, I want to build out the test cases.
