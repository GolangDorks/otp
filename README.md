There are other Go implementations of OTP out there, but this one is mine.

## 2fa: Terminal Authenticator

This project ships with a terminal application for computing one-time passwords using Google Authenticator defaults. See [README](https://github.com/GolangDorks/otp/blob/master/2fa/README.md) for full description.
